# variables

This repository has code explaining the use of variables in C++.

Variables are how computers hold on to data.

Examples of the kind of data we hold in variables are:

Whole numbers: 0, 1, 15, 32, -5, -12...
Whole numbers are stored as the data type (int), this is short for Integer.

Decimal numbers: 1.5, 13.12, -8.75, 3.14, -1.5...
Decimal numbers are stored as the data type (float) or (double), float is short for floating point number, double is twice the size of a float in memory.

Booleans: 0 or 1
Booleans numbers are either zero or one, (bool). Think of these as expressions of truth, 1 -> True, 0 -> False. These numbers are used in logical operations.

Characters: a, b, c, d, A, B, C, D, +, -, /, ^, %, #...
Characters are representation of of things you can produce with your keyboard. They include numbers as well, but they aren't interpreted as numbers. Characters are how computers communicate with users (people).

The variable types listed above are called 'primitive' data types. These data types are part of the core language of C++.

There are more data types available in C++, but we have to include special libraries to use them. These data types are called Abstract Data Types (ADT). The abstract data types are built on top of the primitive data types available by default in C++.

Strings: "Hello World", "Hi there", "Jack", "Jill"...
Strings are collections of characters, or 'strings' of characters. They are used to create messages that allow computers to interact with people.
